# Swatchity
# 2015-September Update

## Background
Swatchity is a social media network where you can only post colors. In that sense, it's largely useless but at the same time highly functional. When I was working on it back in 2014(?) I would describe it to people who would invariably ask, "why do this?" I don't think I ever articulated an answer that satisfied people. I think the real reason had to do with the conversations we would have about it, how silly and impossibly dumb it all was. 

Another reason I made it is because useless yet functional things fascinate and amuse me as creative works. At the time I was thinking about jokes that take a generations or centuries to tell. Specifically, I was thinking of creating a machine that did nothing and burying it somewhere for achaeologists to find after a few millennia and argue over its purpose or, indeed, if if was made by humans at all.

I thought of Swatchity like that. Something that would live in the background for someone to find while searching the web for color scheme ideas, to slowly wade into its weirdness and (spoiler alert) uncover the (fake) cultish underpinnings of the project as they post more colors and level up.

It amused me to think of someone posting a link on Reddit as if they'd discovered this shady organization recruiting members and talking about colors. Or it could slip into obscurity like everything else we make, and that's OK, too.

## Setup
Swatchity is simple to install on a PHP server. Just set up the mysql database and upload the files.
