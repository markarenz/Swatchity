<h1 class="centered_text">Swatchity.com Terms of Service</h1>
<b>Intellectual Property</b>

The code, content, as well as all user posts are the intellectual property of Swatchity. This includes the site's layout, logos, and all artwork. The bugs are our intellectual property, too. If something doesn't work to your satisfaction, rest assured that this is entirely purposeful. It's an artisanal bug. If anyone attempts to write code as slipshod and sloppy as ours in order to create a similar bug, they will be in violation of copyright law. For serious shiz.

<b>Email</b>

Swatchity.com asks for your email address only for the purposes of password retrieval. When people ask if we plan on doing anything nefarious with your email addresses, our collective response is, "Ew! As if!" The site will not issue ten thousand email notifications like certain emotionally needy social platforms do (linked-in, we're looking at you). In fact, Swatchity doesn't send you any email ever. Why should we? If you're not spending every minute on Swatchity posting colors and catching up with friends then it's your loss. On your head be it.  Besides, email is gross. It belongs to a bygone era of dial-up modems and list-serve threads. Ick.


<b>Termination</b>
Swatchity reserves the right to deactivate accounts or ban users for abusive behavior or anything that falls under the category of "sneaky, hackerish shenanigans." This is why we can't have nice things, people. Rotten apples blah blah. By clicking "I agree," users are pledging to behave like well adjusted human persons.


<b>Governing Law</b>
These terms and conditions are governed by US law, and the parties involved agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of US courts.

<b>Links To Other Web Sites</b>
Technically, you can't link out to other websites on this platform, but in the event that someone manages to figure out how to do it, Swatchity is not responsible for any third party websites that are linked from this website. Users are responsible for reading the terms and conditions and privacy policies for those third party websites.

<b>Not A Cult</b>
Swatchity is not a cult. Our founder S. Masterson Paul is not a religious figure. We really, really like the guy- and sometimes we break out in spontaneous and entirely improvised hymns of praise when he enters a room- but he is not a cult leader.  Clicking "I Agree" does not surreptitiously sign you up for a lifetime commitment to the Swatchity brand and lifestyle. You'll find that this is just coincidental. Swatchity is not a cult.


<b>More Text</b>
Our lawyer friend says our ToS is too short and won't look impressive to VC's. So this is an extra paragraph to make it look longer and serious-er. S. Masterson Paul's hair is incredible. It's the kind of coiffure one can only cultivate through a storied career in software sales slash motivational speaking. Sometimes in meetings I find myself just staring at that gorgeous many-hued mop on his head. How could I not? He seems to be aware of it, though. One time a few weeks ago, he caught me staring at it and he's all, "Hey, I'm down here!" Anyway, that brings us to the end of our Terms of Service. I hope you had a good time. My name has been Trevor. Have a great day.
